## User Story

As a college graduate, Michael needs to learn to drink something other than White Claws.

## User Experience

Recipe Room is a web application for the creation, storage, and viewing of cocktail recipes.

On the landing page, the user has the option to either view all recipes or add a new one. The "add recipe" button loads a new page with a form. The user enters a name for their drink, selects the main alcohol type from the dropdown, enters the ounces of that alcohol, enters ingredients, and enters instructions for mixing the drink. When they click the "add" button at the bottom of the page, their drink is added to the recipe database. The "view recipes" button loads a recipes page, initially with all the recipes in the database. At the top of the recipe page is a search bar, which the user may use to narrow their search by alcohol type.
